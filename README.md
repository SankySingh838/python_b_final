3. Can a machine learning model predict the IMDB movie rating of upcoming movies based on statistics of past movies?

4. We expect to make a machine learning model using linear regression that is trained on data from our dataset to predict IMDB scores.

5. Pandas, scikit learn, matplotlib

6. Dataset of imdb move ratings from the past three years and information about them: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashpalsingh1525/imdb-movies-dataset and upcoming movies that we will try to predict the score of: https://screendollars.com/film-data/release-calendar

7. We expect to get somewhat accurate results for the revenue and score, as there are many outliers due to the nature of movies and how much goes into them that we cannot account for. Such outlier causing conditions might be public appeal or prior hype, that may exist due to the movie being a sequel/prequel or highly anticipated.
